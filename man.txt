A tool for managing multiple ElectrumX servers
with various settings (Coins, Ports, Coin forks, etc...)
using very simple and minimal configuration files

Usage: electrum-swarm [OPTIONS] COMMAND [COIN ...]

COIN - An optional list of Coins Names (case insensitive)
       Use 'all' to select all the coins in 'coins.conf'

Options:
      --all                Select all Coins
      --config string      Location of custom config files
                           Defaults to "./shared.conf"
      --debug              Enable debug mode
      --help               Displays this text

Commands:
  install   - If needed, Install docker, download all the docker images
              and create the Host's persistent data folders
  run       - Starts the servers (Runs install if needed)
  stop      - Stops the servers without deleting the containers
  remove    - Removes the servers containers
  compact   - Compacts the Electrumx's database to reduce it's size
              in order to avoiding overflows. Be aware that it might
              take a few hours, and that during that time the
              ElectrumX server won't be availble
  ping      - Checks if the Electrumx's TCP connection is alive
  print     - Prints the settings (Shared and Coin)

Examples:
  1. 'electrum-swarm stop Dogecoin'
  2. 'electrum-swarm --config ./settings.conf run Dogecoin Vertcoin'
  3. 'electrum-swarm --all --config ./settings.conf ping'
  4. 'electrum-swarm print all'
